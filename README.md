## Portfolio
The purpose of this is to showcase the various projects I have created and the variety of programming languages I am familiar with.  This is a living document, and as such is currently incomplete.  The live link for this project can be found on [my Github](https://zk229.github.io/portfolio/).

Placeholder links are currently dummied out but will be implemented as my portfolio expands.
